									Since I was young, I have always enjoyed storytelling and have been curious about why things
									happen the way they do. Questioned why do people behave a certain way, and why one chooses to
									make a certain choice over the other. This curiosity led me to wonder and  find answers to a
									lot of “Whys”. 
									</p>
									<p>
									So that’s how I look at data. I believe each piece of data has a story to tell and a “why” to answer.
									These answers have led me to have a better understanding of the pain points and come up with creative
									solutions to add value to businesses and people around me.
									</p>
									<p>
									Before I started as an Analyst, I have worked for more than 4 years in India in various marketing roles
									in industries such as Technology, Pharmaceutical, Manufacturing, Media and Entertainment.
									<p>
									I want to work with teams and companies wanting to create a difference in this world and make it a little better each day.
									The dream is ‘to put a dent in the Universe’ - Noah Wyle.
